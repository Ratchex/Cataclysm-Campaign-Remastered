# HWRM engine notes

Learned in Phase 0.1 (2026-10-07). Each was confirmed in game.

## Launching a loose-file mod
- `-moddatapath DataCataclysm -overrideBigFile` (path relative to `HomeworldRM\`). The mod root **must contain
  `keeper.txt`** (copied from Homeworld2.big) or the folder is not used as a data root.
- Launch with `-dlccampaign HW1Campaign.big -moviepath DataHW1Campaign` as the HW1 launcher button does.
  Launching the exe with no campaign arguments gives a front end that crashes (`luaconfig/799 CreateRef`).
  `-campaign <name>` restricts Single Player to that one campaign; omit it to see Extra Missions.
- `-windowed` gives an offset UI on this machine; leave it off. `-w/-h/-LogFile` are not engine options.
- Log: `Bin\Release\HwRM.log` (UTF-8 with NUL bytes). `print()` from mission Lua appears in it.

## Campaign file
- Mod campaigns are Extra content: `contentType = 2`, with `contentThumbName`/`contentThumbDesc`, no
  `ExtFilter`/`contentRules` (pattern from stock `rr_oem.campaign` and the Taiidan Republic mod).
- **Every `.campaign` file needs `leveldata/campaign/<contentName>.dds` beside it** (1024x512 BGRA8888 with
  mips). Without it the Single Player screen crashes with `CreateRef FATAL EXIT` - even when another campaign
  is selected, because all campaign files are parsed.
- Mission thumbnails: `ui/mapthumbnails/campaign/<contentName>/<directory>.dds`.
- `contentOrdered = 1` locks missions until the previous one is won.

## Levels
- **`createSOBGroup(name)` before `addToSOBGroup(..., name)`.** Adding to a missing group is an access
  violation (native crash), not a Lua error.
- `raceName = "Kushan"` / `"Taiidan"` works for HW1 races in a mod campaign (with the HW1 DLC loaded).

## Scripts
- `dofilepath("data:scripts/SCAR/KASUtil.lua")` and the other four HW1 emulation files load fine from a mod
  mission; `OnStartOrLoad`, `OnInit`, `Rule_AddInterval`, `Objective_Add`/`Objective_SetState` all work.

## Open: localized strings
- Mission `datfiles.lua` + loose `locale/english/...dat` do not resolve `$IDs` yet (objective shows the raw
  `$2100000`). ID 4200000 produced "Requested string range doesn't exists"; 2100000 gives no error but still
  does not resolve. The Taiidan Republic mod ships its strings as `english.big` in the mod root - try that
  (Phase 0.4). Plain-text strings work meanwhile.
